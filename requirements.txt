# JAX/Flax dependencies for conditional-flow-matching
# 
# Note: If you're using a NumPyro conda environment, it typically already includes:
#   - jax, jaxlib (core JAX)
#   - numpy, scipy (scientific computing)
#   - matplotlib (visualization)
# 
# You'll need to install the additional packages listed below.
# Run: python check_jax_dependencies.py to check what's missing.

# Core JAX ecosystem
jax>=0.4.0
jaxlib>=0.4.0
flax>=0.7.0

# Optimizers (for training)
optax>=0.1.0

# ODE solving (for flow integration)
# Note: diffrax is recommended but jax.experimental.ode can be used as alternative
diffrax>=0.4.0

# Scientific computing
numpy>=1.21.0
scipy>=1.7.0
scikit-learn>=1.0.0

# Optimal Transport (for testing purposes)
pot>=0.9.0

# Visualization
matplotlib>=3.5.0

# Testing
pytest>=7.0.0

# Examples dependencies
absl-py>=0.15.0
tqdm>=4.62.0

# Optional: For CIFAR10 examples (data loading)
# torchvision is only needed if using torch DataLoader for compatibility
# For pure JAX, consider using tensorflow-datasets or other alternatives
torchvision>=0.11.0

# Optional: For FID computation in examples
clean-fid>=0.1.0

# Optional: For single-cell examples (if needed)
# scprep>=1.1.0
# scanpy>=1.9.0
